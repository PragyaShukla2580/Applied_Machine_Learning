In this assignment, I have modularized the code and added
some description to each method so that we can understand
what is the aim of each method.
I have also added a config file that holds all the parameters and
hyperparameters that are used in the project, if any changes
are to be expected in terms of parameters or hyperparameters
used, we can just change them in the config file, they will
automatically be reflected in the project.
I have also added git hooks in this part.
Additionally (for bonus), I have added logging support (part of
monitoring) to our code, that means we will be able to keep
track of where we are and what errors we have encountered in
which part of the code.
Basically, there are 5 types of logging support we can add,
namely, logging.info, logging.debug, logging.error,
logging.warning and logging.critical.
I have added most of them to debug our code while running.
I have also added try exception blocks to stay in touch with
errors.
